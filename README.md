# Django - An Introduction

## 1. Project Setup

### First things first

Let us navigate to the directory and create a virtual environment for the project. Let's type the command

```bash
PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT=1 pipenv install django
```

Here are some descriptions about the command

- It uses Pipenv, a tool that manages Python dependencies and virtual environments, to install the `django` packages into a project.
- The line `PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT=1` tells pipnv, **Rather than using the global shared space create a virtual environment inside the project**

### Create a project

Now coming to the project creation.

```bash
pipenv run django-admin startproject storefront .
```

- `pipenv run django-admin startproject storefront` runs the command inside the pip virtual environemnt
- The `.` at the end tells Django to create the project in the current directory, not a subfolder

### Opening the Shell

Activating the virtual environment we previously created is the standard way to go.

```bash
pipenv shell
```

### Runing the server

If we run the command `django-admin runserver`, it will not run as django-admin does not know which project to run. Instead all the necessary commands needed to run the server are inside the `manage.py` (It was generated when we created the project).

Hence we can run the project using

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
